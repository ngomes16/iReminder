# Introduction

## What is an iReminder?

An iReminder is a Web Application for students to keep track of their assignments and due dates for various courses and from various platforms. In addition, the App provides a Notepad which allows students put personal notes that wonâ€™t be lost. We use databases to store user email, password, and their notes.
